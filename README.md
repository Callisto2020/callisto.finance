<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>If we can email virtually anyone around the globe, why can't we send them money just as easily? Or offer them a loan as conveniently? Why should people be forced to fill intricate documents and wait for days, if not weeks, before the much needed financial help is delivered? These questions form the basis of Decentralized Finance's (DeFi) beliefs, activities, and objectives. The DeFi movement seeks to introduce nearly all banking services on the blockchain. Its primary objective is to promote expediency, safety, and transparency by eliminating intermediaries such as banks, investment funds, and payment service providers.  Even though the technology is still in the experimental stage, the DeFi field is experiencing an incredible surge. By the end of June 2020, the value deployed across a variety of DeFi applications had doubled to surpass two billion US dollars. Despite the rapid expansion of DeFi, most of its applications are still facing several operational challenges. This document quickly discusses some of the pertinent issues facing typical DeFi applications and illustrates how Callisto has implemented solutions to address them.</p> <h2>


Issues facing DeFi applications</h2>
<p>
Decentralized Finance is still in its infancy. For the industry to achieve its ambitions and supplant current legacy systems, it must face off various hurdles that impede its usability and adoptability. According to a survey conducted by Callisto, some of the major challenges facing DeFi companies include lack of liquidity, smart contract vulnerability, user error, internal governance, overcollateralization, and unpredictable market.</p> <h2>


Liquidity challenges</h2>
<p>
Inbound and outbound liquidity is essential for the creation and growth of financial markets. Price discovery and the ability to move in and out of trade positions are still defining features to help cryptocurrency and DeFi reach maturity. Regardless, most blockchain-based applications are susceptible to liquidity problems. Large trades, especially those related to popular assets, move the market at an alarming rate creating volatility, which triggers a cascade of undesirable ripple effects. Consequently, it decreases the credibility of the market and makes people nervous about holding assets. Besides, the lack of liquidity adversely impacts the availability of assets for lending.</p> <h2>


Smart Contract vulnerability</h2>
<p>
The safety and trustworthiness of DeFi applications substantially depend on the reliability of smart contracts. If a contract is released into the ecosystem with a flaw in its code, it can lead to loss of funds. There have been reported cases of hackers exploiting vulnerability in smart contracts to steal assets worth millions. The most notable episodes of smart contract vulnerability involved early versions of Ethereum. The most recent case was an attack on bZx protocol where a hacker exploited subtleties in how 'flash loans' operate to steal thousands of Ether worth thousands of dollars. Though the industry has deployed a series of strategies to combat the issue, there is no guarantee it will not happen again. </p> <h2>
  
  
User error</h2><p>
By eliminating the middlemen, DeFi applications transfer the responsibility of initiating transactions to the user, promoting errors.  Most DeFi developers are finding it quite challenging to address the issue – it is difficult for developers to anticipate how users will interact with their apps. There have been reports of users erroneously sending funds to wrong addresses or mistakenly requesting services they did not intend. Most DeFi apps are resorting to ignoring this issue, hoping users will learn how to use the systems the hard way.</p> <h2>
  

Internal governance</h2><p>
Internal governance of assets significantly affects the success of DeFi apps. Current asset governance models do not specify the criteria for choosing who runs assets. There is always a risk that a given project can change who runs the platform or how it is operated. Some applications do not even bother to notify users of changes in asset management.</p> <h2>


Overcollateralization</h2>
<p>
Because of high volatility, lenders want significantly higher collateral to be put up for their loans. This leads to a situation where many lenders won't work with a borrower unless they can effectively front a significant amount of assets, undermining the essential function of borrowing. This contradicts DeFi philosophy of indiscriminate access to financial services and somehow discourages prospective borrowers from using the service.</p> <h2>


Market unpredictability</h2>
<p>
Decentralized services like DeFi can be volatile and unpredictable. Besides, they are susceptible to cybersecurity risks. There is always a looming risk of stakeholders losing large sums of money. While the provision of insurance plans has been tipped as one of the possible strategies to avert the risk, many DeFi apps still do not provide insurance options to customers.
The principal idea behind the development of Callisto is to provide typical DeFi services and reinforce them with strategies to combat issues discussed in this section. Callisto believes that if they can solve the challenges discussed in this section sustainably, other participants can follow suit hence better chances of the field reaching its ambition of replacing the legacy financial system. The next section discusses how Callisto is developing solutions to these impediments.</p> <h2>


The Callisto.Finance</h2>
<p>
Callisto is the most recent protocol developed to offer revolutionary DeFi services. The platform features a plethora of well-thought features specifically tailored to the needs of each and every type of user. The primary objective of Callisto is to seal technical and operational gaps in the DeFi field and enable users to confidently lend, stake, farm, and borrow. The company's vision is to promote equity and safety through transformational technology, and the mission is to allow everyone to access financial services in a secure and transparent environment.
To break the cycle of recurring issues in the DeFi field, Callisto has re-engineered its protocol to include cutting edge qualities that deliver not only conventional DeFi services in a unique, efficient fashion but also address cyclical challenges that have been ailing the sectors. This section discusses how Callisto addresses each of these problems.</p> <h2>


Liquidity challenges</h2>
<p>
Perhaps, the most important solutions are those that improve and facilitate liquidity. A liquid market will support a fast-growing user base, providing frictionless and enjoyable ways for players to transfer value across different blockchains and their DApps. Callisto employs various strategies to address liquidity problems.</p> <h2>


Vigorous lending community</h2>
<p>
To create an ecosystem that supports quick provision of loans, Callisto builds a robust community that comprises depositors and borrowers. Depositors earn a passive income for providing liquidity, while borrowers have unrestricted access to a variety of loans at unbeatable rates. This symbiotic relationship between depositors and borrowers ensures an unfettered supply of lending resources.</p> <h2>


Yield Farming</h2>
<p>
Yield farming, also referred to as liquidity mining, is a novel way to generate rewards with cryptocurrency holdings. Callisto provides an exceptional yield farming environment where investors can steadily and reliably generate impassive income in the form of rewards. Callisto yield farming service is set to be one of the best in the industry – the company is exploring ways to increase reward rates to attract investors.</p> <h2>


Liquidity Pools</h2>
<p>
Liquidity pools, in essence, are pools of tokens that are locked in a smart contract. They are used to facilitate trading by providing liquidity. Callisto offers a pooling service that can hold multiple types of assets. Furthermore, the platform employs an innovative algorithm that offers a lower fee and minimal slippage when exchanging tokens. The pools' working mechanics are designed to offer convenience and rewards to users, hence motivating them to lock more tokens.</p> <h2>


Smart contract vulnerabilities and user errors</h2>
<p>
Callisto protocol averts the risks associated with faulty code smart contracts by using fully audited smart contracts and only incorporating practices that are peer-reviewed and certified by industry stakeholders as safe. The platform addresses user error glitches by deploying ERC-777 token standards, which can detect and block mistaken transactions. To help other industry participants, Callisto will avail its Launchpad ecosystem to third parties wishing to offer legal services in the crypto space.</p> <h2>


Internal governance</h2>
<p>
Internal governance is a central factor in the growth and success of decentralized. To enrich the governance of Callisto, the platform supports inimitable on-chain voting technology that leverages flexible voting parameters. This methodology will allow users to vote for free, and the results will be verifiable.</p> <h2>


Overcollateralization</h2>
<p>
Overcollateralization contradicts the core purpose of lending. To strike a balance between resources availed for borrowing and collateral attached to them, Callisto  has developed a mathematical model to calculate what depositors can attach to their resources as collateral. In some categories of assets, the platform has outlined the maximum amount of collateral that can be attached to an asset. </p> <h2>


Insurance</h2>
<p>
Callisto understands users' insecurities and risks involving crypto services. To cushion the effects of risks involved, the platform provides an optional insurance program to users. Unlike other platforms that only offer insurance plans to users with colossal funds, Callisto insurance programs are open for all interested users.</p> <h2>


Staking</h2>
<p>
Besides innovating new approaches and providing services that counter challenges ailing the DeFi sector, Callisto provides additional avenues for asset holders to generate income conveniently. One of these avenues is staking. Holders of Callisto assets can stake their shares and earn a fixed return on investment on a daily basis, monthly plan, or annual plan. In contrast to other DeFi players, Callisto users are guaranteed timely returns.</p> <h2>


Conclusion</h2>
<p>
In conclusion, Callisto seeks to revolutionize how financial services are delivered on blockchain technology. The platform intends to address pertinent issues that characterize the DeFi space like liquidity challenges, smart contract vulnerability, user error issues, internal governance problems, overcollateralization, and lack of insurance plans through strategies such as the creation of lending communities, yield farming, liquidity pools, and secure Launchpad ecosystem.
